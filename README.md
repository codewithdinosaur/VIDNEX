* **"Windows protected your PC" popup?**
    * Since this is a custom application, Windows might show a blue warning screen.
    * Click **"More Info"** → **"Run Anyway"** to continue the installation.

* **Port 3000 Error?**
    * If the app closes immediately, check if you already have Vidnex running in the background. Close the old window and try again.
